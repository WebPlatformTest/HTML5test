This is a website for testing web standards in the browser. The HTML5 test score is an indication 
of how well your browser supports the HTML5 standard and related specifications. Find out which 
parts of HTML5 are supported by your browser today and compare the results with other browsers.

The HTML5 test does not try to test all of the new features offered by HTML5, nor does it try to 
test the functionality of each feature it does detect. Despite these shortcomings we hope that 
by quantifying the level of support users and web developers will get an idea of how hard the browser 
manufacturers work on improving their browsers and the web as a development platform.
The score is calculated by testing for the many new features of HTML5. Each feature is worth one or 
more points. Apart from the main HTML5 specification and other specifications created the W3C HTML 
Working Group or WHATWG, this test also awards points for supporting related drafts and specifications.
Please be aware that although the HTML5 specification is now an official recommendation, other 
specifications that are being tested are still in development and could change before receiving 
an official status. In the future new tests will be added for new specifications and existing 
tests will be updated when the specifications change.
